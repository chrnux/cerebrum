Run this on the CVS source to get a compilable version:

  aclocal; autoconf
  ./configure

This was tested using these versions:

  aclocal (GNU automake) 1.4-p4
  autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.53

Developer hints
---------------

  Nice Debian packages to install while developing Cerebrum:

    ant jikes python2.2-elisp

Some core concepts in Cerebrum
------------------------------

 * Entity -- the "superclass" of all kinds of things that can be
   modeled in the Cerebrum core.

 * OU -- useful for modeling organizational structure and info on the
   various organizational units (OUs).

 * Person -- models info on persons related to the organization.

 * Account -- models info on "user accounts", e.g. account ownership
   and authentication data.

 * Group -- models group in a non-target-system-specific way, i.e. a
   single Group in Cerebrum can end up being used as e.g. a NIS
   filegroup, a Active Directory group and/or the set of members on a
   mailing list.

Implementation of a user administration system on top of Cerebrum is
done by adding modules to the Cerebrum core.  Typically, a module will
take care of importing and/or exporting data from/to other systems
(e.g. import person data from a student system), or specialize the
generic nature of the core to the needs of your organization
(e.g. allow Accounts to be specialized as "POSIX users").
