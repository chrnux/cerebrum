This is the configuration for testing all the various modules in Cerebrum.

Location
--------

Please put the tests for one module in its _own directory_ in the location::

    testsuite/tests/

This makes it possible to control what to run nosetests for and not, without
too much configuration.

Example on locations:

    testsuite/tests/test_ad2/
    testsuite/tests/test_cis/

Note that each directory that should be tested must be specified in run.sh, so
it could run nosetest over it. Update the list of test directories in run.sh
when new modules are getting tested.
