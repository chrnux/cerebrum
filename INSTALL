Prerequisities
--------------
Install python >= 2.2, and a PostgreSQL or Oracle database.  Install
python-pgsql >= 2.2 or DCOracle2.

  Debian packages: python2.2 python2.2-xmlbase
                   postgresql python2.2-pgsql
  RedHat packages: ???

Create a database instance where cerebrum should be ran, as well as a
user which cerebrum should connect as.

Instructions for creating the Oracle users:
  CREATE USER cerebrum IDENTIFIED BY somepassword;
  GRANT connect, resource, create role TO cerebrum;
  CREATE USER cerebrum_user identified BY somepassword;
  GRANT connect, resource TO cerebrum_user;

Instructions for creating the PostgreSQL database and user:

  % createuser cerebrum
  % createdb cerebrum

Get the sources
---------------
You can either download a stable version, or use the CVS version.

To get the latest stable version:
  - Dowload Cerebrum-X.Y.tar.gz from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cerebrum/
  - untar the sources into an empty directory

Or get the CVS version:
  - cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.cerebrum.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cerebrum login
  (no password required)
  -cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.cerebrum.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cerebrum \
   co cerebrum


Testing the distribution
------------------------

Set PYTHONPATH to point to the directory where you extracted the
sources.  Edit Cerebrum/cereconf.py and set DB_AUTH_DIR,
CEREBRUM_DATABASE_CONNECT_DATA['user'], DATABASE_DRIVER and
CEREBRUM_DATABASE_NAME. 

Warning: the target datbases cerebrum tables will be dropped and
recreated when running this script!

Run "make check"

If any of the checks failes on your system, you chould investigate the
error before proceeding with the installation.


Installing the software
-----------------------
Enter the directory where you installed the sources, and run:

  ./configure --prefix=/cerebrum
  make
  make install

This will install the Cerebrum python modules into your site-packages
directory.  A number of other files are placed as documented in the
top of setup.py.  To install to an alternative location, use the
--prefix option to install.  If you use --prefix, remember to set
PYTHONPATH when running scripts.

Run 'make bootstrap' to create the required tables.
