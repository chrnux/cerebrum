Minimal requirements
====================

* Apache 2.0.x

* mod_python 2.1.x
  (if you want to use 2.0.x - you'll need to find your own Session provider)

* Python 2.2

* forgetHTML 
  http://forgethtml.sourceforge.net/


Install
=======

Run ./configure --prefix=yada-yada 
    (and optionally --with-webroot=some-where )
from the root.   (remember autoconf if this is a CVS release)

Run make install from the web directory.

You should then be up and running. If you're not - make sure
mod_python is enabled, and that the .htaccess files are working
for your configuration.
