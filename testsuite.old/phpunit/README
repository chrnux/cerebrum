Tests under this directory are made for use by PHPUnit. More information can be
found at:
    
    http://www.phpunit.de/

and the documentation is at:

    http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/

Files that should be tested have to end with Test.php, e.g. EnvironmentTest.php.

Testing should be done through phps cli, e.g. with the command::

    php --configuration ~/test/php.ini /usr/bin/phpunit --configuration testsuite/phpunit/phpunit.xml testsuite/phpunit/

Where the php.ini should be a copy of the php settings from the production
environment, but with extended logging and changed paths. The phpunit.xml
contains the settings for phpunit, it's not necessary to specify it on the
command line if you have a file named phpunit.xml in your $PWD.
