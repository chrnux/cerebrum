Introduction
=============
This documents describes the user management framework CWEB in some of the
Cerebrum [#cerebrum]_ installations.

Today, 2007-03-14, Cerebrum offers essentially three user management
interfaces to the database. In each case, the overall architecture is the same
-- there is a client entity that communicates with a Cerebrum server (bofhd,
[#bofhd]_), which in turn queries the Cerebrum database. The clients are:

  #. JBofh, a command-line interface client written in Java that communicates
     over XMLRPC [#xmlrpc]_ with the bofhd.
  #. Cereweb, a web-based user administration interface to Cerebrum client
     used chiefly at NTNU.
  #. CWEB, another web-based user administration  client used primarily with Indigo-OFK and
     Indigo-giske projects. 

This memo is on the workings of the CWEB framework.

The CWEB framework is based on `CGI
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface>`_. The CWEB modules
are set up to be launched from a CGI script. The modules parse the command
passed to the script by a web server, and communicate with a Cerebrum server
bofhd potentially running on a different machine using XMLRPC [#xmlrpc]_. The
web pages themselves are rendered with the help of Zope page templates
[#zpt]_.

A sketch of the components involved in passing a request to view user
information is presented below.

CWEB architecture
==================
The CWEB "interface" is launched by running the CGI-script ``cweb.py``. The
CWEB itself consists of several components, each of which is responsible for
its own task. The components are:

  * *Controller* class (in file ``Controller.py``) is the wrapper around all
     actions and it decides which method (in CWEB) corresponds to which user
     action (i.e. a magic value submitted via an HTML form). The controller
     wraps the command execution in a try-catch to present a nicer error to
     the end user. Also, the controller restricts the available commands via a
     ``cereconf.CWEB_AVAILABLE_COMMANDS``. Note that this has nothing to do
     with the web pages presented to the end users. I.e. the web page may very
     well "offer" a command, whereas the controller would lock such a command
     out. Obviously, such a situation is probably a bug, but this discrepancy
     is nevertheless possible.
 
  * *Command* classes (in file ``Commands.py``) are classes that implement
     various CWEB commands. Usually a user action (such as "find person") is
     passed to a suitable command object. The command object handles the
     request and calls the necessary methods to present the result (i.e. the
     command object outputs the html page with a result suitably
     formatted). Various command objects are hooked to a controller object
     instantiated by the CGI-script.

  * *CerebrumProxy* class (in file ``CerebrumGW.py``) is a proxy class that
     relays all commands from CWEB to the bofh daemon. This class is
     responsible for establishing a (preferrably) HTTPS connection to the
     bofhd, does a bit of marshalling and massaging the input/output values. A
     ``CerebrumProxy``, object, much like the command objects, is hooked to a
     controller object. The controller also passes the the proxy object to
     command objects, so the entire structure is linked pretty tight together.

  * *State* class (in file ``State.py``) keeps track of the client state (who
     is logged in, their privilege level, which person is being displayed, and
     so forth) with the help of Cookies and gdbm database. A state object
     fetches its state from ``cereconf.CWEB_STATE_FILE``. The controller
     object initializes one state object and passes it around to whatever
     object needs it.

  * A presentation layer (in file ``Layout.py``), which is used to present
    user with web pages (either to fetch a query, or to display query
    results). The presentation layer is a collection of classes to help
    manipulate zope page templates [#zpt]_. Additionally, the page templates
    themselves have to be written. We'll look into this in greater detail in
    `CWEB presentation layer`_. 

An overall sketch of the CWEB components is presented below.

.. image:: images/components.png
   :alt: CWEB components
   :align: center

A controller object holds pointers to everything. Various command objects
consult the state and the proxy objects to fetch the supplied values and pass
on commands to bofhd respectively. 


CWEB security
==============
In general, CWEB is just a client, much like any of the three mention in
`Introduction`_. By design, the main security decisions (authorization,
mostly) are made by the tailored bofhd version. Whichever commands it allows,
are available to users. Ideally, even if CWEB is compromised, it will not be
possible to attack the Cerebrum database.

CWEB operates with 3 privilege levels: c3, c2, c1. c3 level are the superusers
and all commands supported by an installation are available to them. c2 level
is reserved for local IT administrators and they have the permissions to look
users/people up and change users' passwords. c1 are ordinary users and they
can only see the information about themselves and change their own passwords.

When a user logs into CWEB, CWEB establishes the user's privilege level. This
happens in ``modules.bofhd.auth.py``. Currently the permissions are awarded
based on either group membership (for c3) or the ability to perform certain
operations (c2 is awarded to all who can set passwords).

Each privilege level presents a different interface (e.g. a c1 user will never
"see" a web page with a "create group" link). However, a c1 user can still
craft an url and "send" a "create group" request. The verification of a
request is three-folded:

  * The controller object checks whether the command is at all available. The
    commands available on an installation can be constrained through
    ``cereconf.CWEB_AVAILABLE_COMMANDS``
  * A suitable command object or the cerebrum proxy object (see figure in
    section `CWEB architecture`_) will check if the particular user level can
    perform the command (client-side). (FIXME: Currently this happens only
    sporadically and is not enforced through. This should perhaps be fixed, if
    nothing else, than to give a klient a better error message?)
  * Once the bofhd gets the request from the cerebrum proxy object, it
    performs permissions checks once a method for a particular command is
    invoked.


CWEB presentation layer
========================
A word on the presentation layer. As mentioned, CWEB uses Zope page templates
[#zpt]_ to generate webpages. ZPT is a framework that allows to merge HTML
with dynamic page generation. Roughly, a page template is loaded from a file,
and can be rendered (to HTML) while performing certain substitions within the
template. The resulting HTML is then returned from CWEB as "the result" of
running a CGI script.

ZPT 
----
ZPTs, Zope page templates, are regular HTML files, with certain directives
embedded into them. In CWEB these directives are used to merge dynamic content
(e.g. user names, person names, affiliations, etc.) into HTML pages generated
by the CGI script.

When a ZPT is rendered (``__call__`` method for suitable class in ZPT), every
magic "directive" (they are written in a language called TAL, template
attribute language [#tal]_) is replaced by a value from a context dictionary
which is supplied to the render call. CWEB puts all the required values into
such a dictionary before asking ZPT to render a template.

Templates are located in ``contrib/no/Indigo/web/templates``. They are also
grouped by sites (``cereconf.CWEB_TEMPLATE_SITE_DIR``), so that a
site-specific template is preferred to a default one
(``...web/templates/default``), when both exist. The templates are loaded in
``Layout.py:MyPageTemplate.load``.


Page layout and ZPT macros
---------------------------
In order to give all of the pages similar look, we use macros in ZPTs in
CWEB. Normally, you would not need to define your own, just know how to use
the existing ones. There is one macro in CWEB -- "page". Today, 2007-03-19, it
has four different incarnations -- for displaying user, group and person query
results and a general macro that's used for everything else.

The general macro (``outer.zpl``) defines a layout that looks approximately
like this: ::

    +-------------+
    |    header   |
    +-+-----------+
    |m|           |
    |e|           |
    |n| bodyframe |
    |u|           |
    | |           |
    +-+-----------+ 

"menu" and "bodyframe" in the figure above are macro slots (i.e.
``metal:define-slot``), called "menuframe" and "bodyframe"
respectively. "menuframe" is filled with a suitable menu (selected based on a
privilege level) and "bodyframe" is populated by a template specific to the
command being run. This way *all* pages have the same general look.

Typically a page for doing any kind of task (say, a query page for locating a
user, ``user_find.zpl``), will include something like this: ::

  <span metal:use-macro="tpl/macros/page">
  <span metal:fill-slot="body" tal:omit-tag="">

... at the top of the page. This way, a page (for asking for username search
criteria in our example) will look "the same" compared to all other user
pages. Note the string ``tpl/macros/page``. ``tpl`` is the name of the object
in python code that holds the macros. ``macros`` is a fixed string (fixed in
the ZPT framework) to designate that whatever follows names a macro and
finally ``page`` is the name of the macro that has to be used.

The other three "page" macro incarnations, ``user_frame.zpl``,
``person_frame.zpl`` and ``group_frame.zpl`` (that are very similar,
actually), are used to fill the "bodyframe" slot of the general outer
macro. They all look like this: ::

  <span metal:define-macro="page" tal:omit-tag="">
    <table> 
      <tr>
        <td><h1 tal:content="title">title</h1></td> 
        <td><a tal:replace="structure python:help_link(title_id,'')"></a></td>
      </tr> 
    </table>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><span metal:define-slot="body" tal:omit-tag=""></span></td>
        <td><iframe src="about:blank" name="helpframe" frameborder="0"> </iframe></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </span>

Each page is generated in two steps: first step is the content that ends up in
the "bodyframe". Once it has been generated, it is embedded into the "outer"
pager (controlled by the ``outer.zpl``) macro. This "embedding" of one page
into another happens in ``Layout.py:SubTemplate.show()`` and
``Layout.py:MainTemplate.show()``.


How does it all work?
----------------------
Okey, so how exactly does all of this fit together? Initially, the only
"interface" available is two input boxes for logging in (username and
passwords). Once a user has logged in, (s)he is presented with an interface
suitable for his/her privilege level (``Layout.py:MainTemplate.get_menu()``
fetches the right menu template). Each command fills the "bodyframe" slot in
the figure mentioned previously. The result of each command fills the
"bodyframe" slot as well. E.g. person commands (handled by
``Commands.py:PersonCommands``) usually end up by calling
``template.show(...)``, where ``template`` is an instance of
``PersonTemplate``. To render such a ``PersonTemplate`` template, two things
are required: 

  #. a macro for the body layout (``person_fram.zpl``), which tells where the
     body of the resulting page goes.
  #. a template for the command result (specific to each command), that
     actually *is* the body of the resulting page. 

Typically, in order to introduce a new command, or display an additional
result, one would only need to fix the template for the command result. The
rest of the web page layout/infrastructure would simply "just work".

The zope page template framework is not really complicated, but there are many
pieces that have to work together, which makes it somewhat difficult to get a
grasp of the framework. There are templates and macros, that define the layout
of the webpage, there is some python code that massages the results in python
and passes commands to bofhd, and then there is bofhd which actually executes
the commands. The easist way of understanding how it works it to trace an
existing command, such as "find person" all the way through.


CWEB hacking
=============
Assuming that you want to extend a running instance of CWEB, here are the
places where you can start tweaking.

Perhaps, it is easiest to do this by following an example through. Suppose you
want to make a function, "punish user" available to the c2 and c3
users. Let's assume that punishing a user means setting a random password and
removing a group membership (supplied by the operator). There are essentially two
inputs here -- user name and group name. There is a number of possible error
situations, but we'll deal with them later.

You'll have to go through roughly these steps:

  #. Find out which page is to be supplemented with a link to the "punish
     user" command. Suppose you want to make a link from the main menu. Then a
     template for c2 and c3 users can be extended thus: ::
 
       <dt>Menu
       <dd>
         <a href="?action=show_person_find">Find person</a></br>
         <!-- same list as before -->
         <a href="?action=show_punish_user">Punish user</a></br>
     
     The next time any page is loaded by a c2/c3 user, they'll see a clickable
     link that leads them to the ``show_punish_user`` command/page.

  #. ... which brings us to the next point -- the template for the "punish
     user" command (i.e. which page is to be displayed when executing
     ``show_punish_user``).

     Let's assume that we need a text field (for the username) and a submit
     button. A prospective template may then look like this: ::

       <!-- remember our macros to give all pages the same look -->
       <span tal:define="title string:Look for users to punish" tal:omit-tag="">
       <span metal:use-macro="tpl/macros/page">
       <span metal:fill-slot="body" tal:omit-tag="">

       <form action="#" method="get">
         <input type="HIDDEN" name="action" value="do_punish_user">
         <dl>
           <dt>Username
           <dd><input type="TEXT" name="user_name" size="20">
           <br>
           <dt><input type="TEXT" name="group_name" size="20">
         </dl>

         <input type="SUBMIT" value="Punish!">
       </form>
    
     The worthy key points here are ``name`` and ``value`` attributes. These
     are the "tags" we'll need later to fetch the proper values from the
     ``UserCommand`` class. 

     Let's call our template ``user_punish.zpl``. If the template is general
     enough, it should probably end up in
     ``contrib/no/Indigo/web/templates/default``. Or, if the template is
     installation-specific, then it should be placed in
     ``contrib/no/Indigo/web/templates/<institution>``.

     To summarize, a template in this case needs:

       #. a form (``<form>``) through which a request is submitted.
       #. a standard header, so that the query page conforms to the overall
          layout and looks "the same" as the rest of the CWEB web pages. This
          is what the ``use-macro`` is for.
       #. a few tags within the form that will let the Command class to
          identify various parts of user input. It does not matter what they
	  are called, however, the tags should be unique within one template
	  and the ``name`` attribute of the ``<input>`` that registers which
          action should be called in the controller *must* be called
          ``action``. 
  
     Keep in mind that we'll need a second template, to present the output of
     the "punish user" command to the user.

  #. Now, we have a link in the menu and a template to use when the link is
     clicked. What we need is to establish a "connection" in the
     ``Controller`` class between the "show_punish_user" action and the
     template to be displayed. This is accomplished by registering the proper
     entry in the ``Controller.action_map`` dictionary: ::

       def controller(self):
           action_map = {
	       # as before
	       'show_user_punish': [self.html_util.show_page,
                                    Layout.UserTemplate, 'user_punish'],
           }

     What does all of this mean? Well, when the controller sees the action
     "show_user_punish" (which is exactly what would happen, because of the
     URL with "?action=show_user_punish"), it'll execute ``show_page``
     function with a ``UserTemplate`` using the ``user_punish.zpl`` template
     that we've just designed. Yay! We are ready to move on ... 

  #. ... to actually implementing the punishing part. When the operator pushes
     the "Punish!" button, we want to call the command that actually does
     something to a user. So, once more, we need to tie the ``action`` in the
     ``user_punish.zpl`` template to whatever method implements the
     command; and that happends in ``action_map``: ::

       def controller(self):
           action_map = {
	       # as before
	       'show_user_punish': [self.html_util.show_page,
                                    Layout.UserTemplate, 'user_punish'],
               'do_punish_user': [self.user_cmd.user_punish],
           }

     The next time the operator hits the "Punish!" button on the web page, the
     controller will call ``user_punish`` method in class ``UserCommands`` ...

  #. ... which we now have to implement. ``user_cmd`` in the previous bullet
     is an instance of class ``UserCommands``, and since we want to perform an
     operation on a *user*, it makes sense to place the code there.

     We have to perform two distinct operations here: scrambling the password
     and removing a specific membership.
     
     So, let's deal with the password scrambling first. We need to perform
     roughly these commands:
 
       #. Check that the operator *can* in fact punish users: ::
       
            def user_punish(self):
	        html_util = self.state.controller.html_util

                if self.state.get("authlevel") < 'c2':
  	            html_util.error("Insufficient privilege to punish users")
		    return 

          If the operator cannot punish users, then there is no point in
          asking bofhd to perform anything. (FIXME: the multiple dotting is a
          bit ugly. Since all these classes are tightly coupled anyway,
          perhaps it makes sense to make this a bit easier?)
     
       #. So, assuming the operator has permissions, whose password are we
          scrambling? Well, remember that ``name`` attribute with value
          ``user_name`` in the HTML form? That's exactly what we want: ::

            def user_punish(self):
                # as before 
		
                user_to_punish = self.state.get_form_value("user_name")
		
          The victim is found!

       #. Now we actually scramble the password. There is already a command to
          change a user's password, so we'll just reuse it: ::

            def user_punish(self):
	        # as before

                user_to_punish = self.state.get_form_value("user_name")
		candidates = self.cerebrum.user_find("uname", user_to_punish)
		if len(candidates) != 1:
		    html_util.error("User is not unique!")
		    return

                account_id = candidates[0]['account_id']
		# set the password now. None means give random password
		self.cerebrum.user_password(account_id, None)

          So far, so good. But what if setting the password fails on bofhd's
          end (e.g. the db is down or a transaction is aborted)? Well, in that
          case bofhd will raise an exception which will be "forwarded" by the
          ``cerebrumProxy`` and caught by the controller. The ``user_punish``
          is not involved in handling this kind of errors.

       #. Now that we have scrambled the password, we can move on to removing
          the membership. Much like with the user name, the group name was in
          an ``<input>``-element with attribute ``name`` set to
          ``group_name``. Thus, we collect the name, and proceed much like
          before: ::

	    def user_punish(self):
	        # as before
 
                group_name = self.state.get_form_value("group_name")
                groups = self.cerebrum.group_search("name", group_name)
		if not groups:
		    html_util.error("No group matches name '%s' % group_name)
		    return 
		elif len(groups) > 1:
		    html_util.error("Too many groups match name '%s'" % group_name)
		    return
                
		group_id = groups[0]["entity_id"]

		# ok, we've got both account_id and group_id -- register change.
		self.cerebrum.group_remove_entity((account_id,), group_id)
               
       #. And finally, at least some sort of user feedback would be
          nice. Since none of the existing templates fit, we create a minimal
          one -- ``user_punish_ok.zpl``: ::

            <span tal:define="title string:User punished" tal:omit-tag="">
              <span metal:use-macro="tpl/macros/page">
                <span metal:fill-slot="body" tal:omit-tag="">

                  <p>User punished!</p>
                </span>
              </span>
            </span>

          ... and then amend ``user_punish`` with a report page at the end: ::

            def user_punish(self):
                # as before

                tpl = UserTemplate(self.state, "user_punish_ok")
                return tpl.show({})
            # end user_punish

          Now we are done, and we can punish users left and right.

So, to reiterate. To implement a new command, you'd need:

  #. About two templates (one for displaying the "dialogs" that ask for
     operator input; and another for displaying the results). 
  #. Hook up the new functionality somewhere (a suitable menu, a particular
     templates (such as e.g. ``person_info.zpl``))
  #. Link up the forms with the commands (in ``Controller.py``)
  #. Implemented the commands (somewhere in ``Commands.py``, and perhaps
     ``CerebrumGW.py`` if the proxy needs to do something fancy).
  #. Implement the necessary functionality bofhd-side, if needed (in
     ``bofhd_go_cmds.py``)
  #. `profit! <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpants_Gnomes#The_gnomes>`_



CWEB setup
===========
Assuming that you want an instance of CWEB up and running, these are the
software requirements and configuration options you have to tweak.


Software requirements
----------------------
In addition to all of the software requirements for Cerebrum, a CWEB
installation requires zope page templates [#zpt]_. Make sure that the prefix
where the software is installed is available to the user that renders the
pages (e.g. CGI scripts may be run by user nobody)


Configuration
--------------
Here is a short list of things you should keep in mind when configuring CWEB
on a new installation. 

  * Install zope page templates [#zpt]_. Version 1.4 would do nicely. It's
    probably best to install it to ``/site``. Make sure that the user running
    CWEB has access to the right python and has ``/site/lib/...`` in
    ``PYTHONPAHT``. 
  * Define several variables in ``cereconf.py``, so that CWEB can locate
    templates and its components: 

    =============================  ==================================================
    ``CWEB_TEMPLATE_DIR``          The "root" directory well all templates are
                                   located.
    ``CWEB_TEMPLATE_DIR_DIR``      The name of the directory with site-specific
                                   templates. E.g. "ofk" or "giske". Such a
                                   directory must exist under ``CWEB_TEMPLATE_DIR``
    ``CWEB_BOFH_SERVER_URL``       Location of the bofhd that the CWEB
                                   framework passes the commands to. The format
                                   looks like this "protocol:host:port", where
                                   "port" is optional. The protocols can be
                                   "http" or "https". "https" is recommended.
    ``CWEB_LOG_FILE``              Logfile for the CWEB framework (the logger
                                   is fetched from the python's logging
                                   framework. We may want to change that in the
                                   future. In that case, this variable will
                                   disappear). This is useful mainly for
                                   debugging.
    ``CWEB_STATE_FILE``            Client-state file (basically, a bunch of
                                   cookies in a gdbm database).
    ``CWEB_ACTIVE_SOURCE_SYSTEM``  Name of the authoritative system where
                                   people must have affiliations to be
                                   considered 'active'. Used by
                                   bofhd. Typically, only active people are
                                   returned as query results.
    ``CWEB_AVAILABLE_COMMANDS``    Is a sequence of function names that are
                                   available in the CWEB framework. Although
                                   each new installation potentially needs a
                                   bunch of new templates, the code for
                                   processing commands may remain
                                   unchanged. This variable can be used to
                                   "turn off" some functionality, without any
                                   code changes to CWEB/bofh.
    ``BOFHD_AUTH_LEVEL``           Is used by bofhd to partition the users into
                                   superusers, lita and regular users. It's a
                                   dictionary from strings ('super',
                                   'schoolit', 'other') to numerical values
                                   designating privilege thresholds.
    ``BOFHD_NEW_GROUP_SPREADS``    is a sequence of spreads (spread names,
                                   i.e. ``code_str``) *always* given to groups
                                   created via the CWEB interface.
    =============================  ==================================================

    Also, make sure that the directories actually exist (e.g. the directory
    for log/state files).

  * Fix ``config.dat`` for ``bofhd``. We need to include at least
    ``Indigo/bofhd_go_cmds``. 
  * Remember that each new installation may need its own templates. 

Apache has to be configured as well, and there are several key points in that
configuration as well. 

  * Don't forget the SSL-certificates. 
  * ``/etc/httpd.conf``. The easiest is probably to migrate the
    ``/etc/httpd.conf`` from an existing installation.
  * Don't forget the logos (supplied by the institution that requested CWEB)
    and a stylesheet.
  * Set up symlinks from whichever directories ``/etc/httpd.conf`` declares to
    cweb.py in the *installed* cerebrum/CWEB tree.
