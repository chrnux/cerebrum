<h1>Introduction</h1>

This document describes the protocol used to interact between the
Cerebrum administration server and its clients.

<p>

The protocol is based on TCP/IP, and servers implementing it are
listening on port XYZ.

<p>

This is work in progress

<h2>Request -&gt; response protocol</h2>

In this protocol, the client is allowed to send messages, which the
server replies to.  The server does not explicitly contact the client
on its own.

<h2>Protocol encoding</h2>

Messages and responses are implemented using <a
href="http://www.xml-rpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>, an open standard that
allows clients to call methods on a server.  The method calls and the
return values are encoded as XML.  All of this is automatically handled
by xmlrpclib which is included in Python.

<p>

XML-RPC was originally built for HTTP, but can also be used on top of
other protocols.

<h2>XML-RPC over HTTPS</h2>

The request-&gt;response behavior of a typical bofh client makes HTTP
a suitable protocol for transfer of the XML-RPC messages.  However,
for security reasons, <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt">HTTPS</a> is used.

<p>

In the future, we might decide to use another transfer protocol.  This
should only require minor changes to clients/servers.

<p>

It is legal for the client to have multiple requests running at the
same time with the same sessionid.

<h1>Methods</h1>

The return values of XML-RPC callable methods can among other things
be dictionaries, lists strings and integers.

<p>

As the server is extend-able by modules all methods will not be
described here.  Use the python help function for a list of callable
methods in a given module.

<p>

When an error occurs, a xmlrpclib.Fault is raised with the message
parameter describing the cause of the error.

<h3>TODO</h3>

We might want to do something more fancy to fake various kinds of
exceptions, useful exceptions could be:

<ul>
<li>AuthenticationError
<li>InvalidSessionError (sessions time-out after some time?)
<li>BadArgError
</ul>

This would probably requiring clients to wrap the calls to the server
methods so that xmlrpclib.Fault could be converted to something else.
HOW?

<h2>login(uname, password</h2>

<pre>sessid = testsvr.login(user, passwd)</pre>

The login method authenticates the user.  Upon success, a sessionid is
returned which must be used for future communication with the server.

<h2>ping()</h2>
Returns the string <code>pong</code> to indicate that the server is alive

<h2>get_commands(sessionid)</h2>

This command returns a tuple of tuples describing the commands
available in the server for the user with the corresponding sessionid.
The format of the data is as follows:

<pre> 
#   protocol_command  bofh_cmd1 bofh_cmd2 parameter[1..n] #of_loopable_param
commands = (
    ('get_person', 'person', 'get', 'number', 1),
    ('add_fg', 'filegroup', 'add', 'string', 'string', 1),
</pre>

Here protocol_command is the name of the function that will be called
in the server.  bofh_cmd1 and bofh_cmd2 are the keywords that uniqualy
identifies this command.  parameter[1..n] indicates the expected type
of the parameter.  Legal types are:

<ul>
<li>number
<li>string
</ul>

The last number is only used by the client to make it able to encode
multiple server commands from one user command if the user wants to
perform the same action on multiple targets.  In the example above, if
the user typed: <code>filegroup add user1 user2 group</code>, the
client should send:
<pre>add_fg(user1, group)
add_fg(user2, group)
</pre>

<h2>validate(argtype, arg)</h2>
<pre>if validate('fodselsnr', 12345678901):</pre>
Validates that arg is legal for the given argtype, and returns 1 on
success, otherwise raises an error.  The defined argtypes are:

<ul>
<li>fodselsnr : Norwegian social security number
</ul>

See the server source code for a complete list.

<h2>help(keyword)</h2>

Returns a string with help for the given keyword

<h2>run_command(sessionid, *args)</h2>

Calls one of the methods returned from get_commands().  See the help
for the given method for parameters and return values.

<p>

The usage of run_command() as a wrapper for all other functions allows
centralized handling of some authenticaion logic and any server
messages (see below).  One might argue that the methods should be exported
directly, but this will put a greater burden on the server
implementator not to accidentaly make it possible to call methods
without being authenticated.


<h1>Extension to the run_command() return values</h1>

The server may wish to notify the client of an event.  Since the
server cannot send messages to the client, all responses to the
run_command() are prepended with a server_msg.

<pre>server_msg, ret_value = server.function()</pre>

The legal values for server_msg are:

<ul>
<li>reload: Notifies the client that it should restart itself.
Typically called when the authenticated user has gotten more/less
rights and one wants to update the list of available commands
<li>echo;msg: Echo the given message on the client
</ul>

<h1>Extending bofhd.py</h1>

<code>config.dat</code> contains a list of the modules that should be
loaded into bofhd.  It contains a number of lines of the format:
<pre>module_file classname</pre> module_file does not have a .py
ending.

classname must implement a method <code>get_commands(self,
uname)</code> with return values on the same format as described above.

<p>
Will we do this?:<br> 

The protocol_commands specified will automatically be prepended with
module_file so that name-clashes for method names will be avoided.  No
steps are taken to avoid clash of command names.
