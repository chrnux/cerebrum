  RESPONSIBILITY OF: RF, HM

  All "live" Cerebrum access from outside of the Cerebrum installation
  proper should be done through this server.

  Some of the (query) operations it supports should not require the
  client to authenticate, e.g. "Does the password 'foo' satisfy the
  current password quality criteria?"; other operations definitely
  requires client authentication, e.g. "Change password of user 'bar'
  to 'foo'".
