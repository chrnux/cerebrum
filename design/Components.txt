The Cerebrum distribution consists of the following code components:


Core API
--------
  STATUS: Started, but still incomplete and likely to change.
	  During 2002-09 this API should be somewhat usable.

  RESPONSIBILITY OF: HM, *

  API and utility functions for connecting to the Cerebrum database
  and performing operations on the core entities it models.

  TBD: Should not depend on what Python DB-API backend module is used
       to access the database.

  CODE DEPENDENCIES: Python 2.2.1
		     Cerebrum core database structures
		     Cerebrum/extlib/db_row.py

  FILES:
    Cerebrum/{Errors,Utils,Database,DatabaseAccessor}.py
    Cerebrum/{Entity,OU,Person,Account,Group}.py


POSIX users and groups
----------------------
  STATUS: Not started.
	  Should be somewhat usable by the end of 2002-10-10.

  RESPONSIBILITY OF: SS, KTH, HM

  Extra database structures for specializing the core entities
  "Account" and "Group" into the corresponding POSIX terms, and API to
  access these new structures.

  CODE DEPENDENCIES: Core API

  FILES:
    Cerebrum/modules/POSIX_{user,group}.py
    design/mod_posix.sql

----------
  STATUS: Not started.
	  Should be usable by the end of 2002-10-10.

  RESPONSIBILITY OF: SS, KTH

    design/mod_nis.sql

User administration protocol
----------------------------
  STATUS: Started reviewing options.

User administration server
--------------------------
  STATUS: Started working on design (what protocol should we use?).

  RESPONSIBILITY OF: RF, HM

  All "live" Cerebrum access from outside of the Cerebrum installation
  proper should be done through this server.

  Some of the (query) operations it supports should not require the
  client to authenticate, e.g. "Does the password 'foo' satisfy the
  current password quality criteria?"; other operations definitely
  requires client authentication, e.g. "Change password of user 'bar'
  to 'foo'".
