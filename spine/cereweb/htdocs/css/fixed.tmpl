 * Magic to do 'frames' from CSS.
 * 
 * Essentially the trick is to make body only 100% high (ie. the screen
 * size) - and let div.content be the main content, and that div can
 * scroll away down the side.
 * 
 * This allows fixed positioning even in Microsoft IE, as we can use
 * position: absolute for elements directly within body.
 * 
 * Note however that a little trick in fixed.css needs to be included:
 *   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/fixed.css" >
 *   <!--[if IE]>
 *     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/fixed_ie5.css">
 *   <![endif]-->
 */

## Used to position the frames correctly, so they dont overlap eachother.
## 
#set $menuwidth = 7
#set $bottomheight = 9
#set $paddingtop = 1

/* The actual content area. */
#set $realpadding = 1
#set $paddingleft = $menuwidth + $realpadding + 1
#set $paddingbottom = $bottomheight + $realpadding
