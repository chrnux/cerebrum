"""Cerebrum-tailored wrapper around the 'logging' module.

The 'logging' module, which is bundled with Python 2.3 and onwards,
needs a little bit of configuration before being usable by Cerebrum.
Rather than have each and every Cerebrum script copy-and-paste the
code doing this configuration, we provide this module for doing it.

With this module, any Cerebrum component that wants to log stuff, can
get away with as little setup code as this (which still retains the
configurable flexibility provided by the 'logging' module):

  from Cerebrum import Logging
  logger = Logging.getLogger(NAME_OF_WANTED_LOGGER)

"""

import sys
import logging

# Now, any Cerebrum module that does the equivalent of
#   from Cerebrum import Logging
# should be able to access the real 'logging' module through
# Logging.logging.  For increased ease of use, however, we mirror some
# of the most commonly used constants/functions into this module.

for attr in ('getLogger', 'disable', 'shutdown',
             'ALL', 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'FATAL', 'CRITICAL'):
    globals().setdefault(attr, getattr(logging, attr))
del attr

# Configure for Cerebrum logging.
import cereconf
logging.fileConfig(cereconf.LOGGING_CONFIGFILE)
