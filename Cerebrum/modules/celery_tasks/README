celery_tasks is a Cerebrum module that defines and deals with asynchronous
tasks using the Celery framework.

The tasks are packaged in different apps in the apps directory.
Currently the only app is the scheduler app containing the schedule_message
task.


tiny_scheduler
--------------

tiny_scheduler as the name suggests is a tiny daemon that consumes from a
dedicated queue.

It inspects the message body of an ordinary Cerebrum (or other system) event
and looks for the scim property 'nbf' (Not BeFore). It the property is present,
tiny_scheduler calls the apps.scheduler.schedule_message Celery-task providing
the 'nbf'-value (as a datetime.datetime object) as ETA parameter.
If 'nbf' is not present, the message is simply ignored.

tiny_scheduler can be run as:
python tiny_scheduler.py -H mq-prod01.uio.no -u celery_test -V /no/uio/integration_test

python tiny_scheduler.py -h provides a complete list and description of options
