"""
This file serves as an empty placeholder/template so that the password
service can be run 'as is' without any import errors or
suchlike. Note, however, that the config in 'default_password_config'
is more an example than something actually useful.

Site-specific config should be put here, with default_password_config
picking up the slack (if any).
