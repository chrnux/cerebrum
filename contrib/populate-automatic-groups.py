"""Synchronize several automatically maintained groups in Cerebrum.

The complete specification of this script is in
cerebrum-site/doc/intern/felles/utviling/auto-grupper-spesifikasjon.rst.

A few salient points:

* This script synchronizes (i.e. creates, changes memberships, deletes)
  several groups based on the information already found in
  Cerebrum. Technically, it duplicates information otherwise available;
  however having these groups will make a number of tasks considerably
  easier.

* All such automatic groups are tagged with a special trait. Only such
  automatic groups can have this trait.

* Some groups have people as members (person_ids); others have other automatic
  groups as members.
